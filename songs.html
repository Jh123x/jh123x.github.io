            [Verse 1: Andrew Taggart]<br>
            Hey, I was doing just fine before I met you<br>
            I drink too much<br>
            And that's an issue, but I'm okay<br>
            Hey, you tell your friends<br>
            It was nice to meet them<br>
            But I hope I never see them again<br>
            <br>
            [Pre-Chorus: Andrew Taggart]<br>
            I know it breaks your heart<br>
            Moved to the city in a broke-down car<br>
            And four years, no calls<br>
            Now you're lookin' pretty in a hotel bar<br>
            And I-I-I can't stop<br>
            No, I-I-I can't stop<br>
            <br>
            [Chorus: Andrew Taggart]<br>
            So, baby, pull me closer<br>
            In the backseat of your Rover<br>
            That I know you can't afford<br>
            Bite that tattoo on your shoulder<br>
            Pull the sheets right off the corner<br>
            Of the mattress that you stole<br>
            From your roommate back in Boulder<br>
            We ain't ever getting older<br>

            [Post-Chorus: Andrew Taggart]<br>
            We ain't ever getting older<br>
            We ain't ever getting older<br>
            <br>
            [Verse 2: Halsey]<br>
            You look as good as the day I met you<br>
            I forget just why I left you, I was insane<br>
            Stay and play that Blink-182 song<br>
            That we beat to death in Tucson, okay<br>
            <br>
            [Pre-Chorus: Halsey]<br>
            I know it breaks your heart<br>
            Moved to the city in a broke-down car<br>
            And four years, no call<br>
            Now I'm lookin' pretty in a hotel bar<br>

            I've been reading books of old<br>
            The legends and the myths<br>
            Achilles and his gold<br>
            Hercules and his gifts<br>
            Spiderman's control<br>
            And Batman with his fists<br>
            And clearly I don't see myself upon that list<br>
            <br>
            [Pre-Chorus: Chris Martin]<br>
            But she said, where'd you wanna go?<br>
            How much you wanna risk?<br>
            I'm not looking for somebody<br>
            With some superhuman gifts<br>
            Some superhero<br>
            Some fairytale bliss<br>
